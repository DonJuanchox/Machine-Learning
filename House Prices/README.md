# House Prices Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of houses, the model aims to provide accurate price estimations, which can be valuable for real estate professionals and potential buyers.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks detailing the data exploration, preprocessing, and model development processes.
- **models/**: Saved machine learning models for future use.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various features such as:

- **OverallQual**: Overall material and finish quality
- **GrLivArea**: Above-ground living area square footage
- **GarageCars**: Size of garage in car capacity
- **TotalBsmtSF**: Total square feet of basement area
- **1stFlrSF**: First-floor square footage
- **ExterQual**: Exterior material quality

These features are used to predict the target variable, **SalePrice**, which represents the sale price of the house.

## Getting Started
